deb8e7c Slight refactor of Block_____, moving the activated part to BlockMachine adding small upgrade system (upgrade items), when you rclick the injector it puts the upgrade into a special part of the GUI (NOT A SLOT), only way to take it out is breaking the machine ATM. injector only has 1 upgrade slot (redoing the GUIs will include more upgrade slots) more upgradable machines will be available soon.
