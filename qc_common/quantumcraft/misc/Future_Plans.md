Now before we started working on this mod, I had research planned. Like on paper. And I seem to have lost the paper
as i do with all the papers. So I'm gonna start over. This stuff will be in the research book when it gets done.

We've got 2 axis in our research book don't we? that allows us to have 2 different ways we divide the features of the mod

The mod will be divided into multiple technologies which allow you to take advantage of different quantum phenomenons
y axis in the research book
    (example: ION technologies)
It will also be divided into multiple tech levels similar to RP2 (If you remember that anyways cause it's been
a long time -.-)
x axis in the research book
    (example: ION technologies can span over multiple tech levels. less advanced stuff (ION forge) can go to TECH-001
              and more advanced (mining system) can go to TECH-002 or higher. Its the same technology but it is in
              multiple tech levels.)


*list of technologies:*

1) I.O.N Technologies (Yes the official name has dots in it.)

*list of TECH levels:*

TECH-000: (workname "base")
    This should contain the simplest machines of all. With machines from this tech level, you will not be able to do
    much useful stuff, only get QEUs from crystals, + The injector and extractor. This also includes the FiberWire

    STUFF LIST:
        Q De-Energizer QDE   <- Crytallized Quantonium energy extraction
        Q E Injector   QEI   <- Inject QEUs to chargable items (Tools + Capacitor)
        Q E Extractor  QEE   <- Extract QEUs from chargable items
        Q FiberWire    QFW   <- Transfer QEUs around
