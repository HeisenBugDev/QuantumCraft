How to release a new version of QuantumCraft!

Step one, be hunterboerner. Please, nobody else do this. Srsly, even he breaks stuff.

Version should be x.x.x NEVER EVER x.x
EX: 0.4.0 NOT 0.4, Build script will get funky

Before release:
Make sure all issues on GitHub for that version are closed
Test it!!!!

Check readme and update if needed.
Create a new release with git flow with the version as the release name. Ex: 1.3 NOT v1.3
Do any last minute changes.
Finish the release
Push to remote.

Go to GitHub and edit the release notes for this tag version (this is the changelog!)
Go to the jenkins(don't put a link here anyone) and download the file for the version released in the job called QuantumCraft NOT QuantumCraft-dev
Put the file on dropbox under public/QuantumCraft
Go to adf.ly and shorten the link.
Edit the minecraftforum post to reflect the new versions.
Reply to the post on MCForums and have:
    A link to the changelog
    The actual changelog (for the lazy)
    And obviously the version number!
Go to #notenoughmods in irc.esper.net and give them the info for the new version
