QuantumCraft
============

Yet another minecraft tech mod that ends with -craft.

We took some of our code from MineFactory Reloaded if you are wondering why things look similar. The reason? He is a much better programmer and makes a good outline and base classes for stuff. Yeah, I have no clue what I am saying, let's hope his liscense allows this.
We also got some code from MrTJP who makes [Project: Red](https://github.com/MrTJP/ProjectRed)

We will be using [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) _except_ anthing before 1.0. If it is 0.x then it means we have not officially released it and will not be considered stable or in anyway complete for playing. Once we get to 1.0 we will start using the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) scheme. I actually have no clue if this makes sense. How 'bout we just say that if it is a 0.x version then we are still working a lot on leveling everything out. Okey?

If you find an issue you can either submit it on github which would be the best, fork it fix it and send us a PR, or lastly send us a PM/post on [minecraftforum.net](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1122448-hunterboerner/)

We will also be setting up some documentation soon with a todo list on what we are going to implement. We _may_ use what we did on the last version of QuantumCraft and just make a php site with bootstrap that is static.

We would love feedback so just send it on over!

*PLEASE USE GIT FLOW STUFF NO PUSH MASTER STUFF*

Todo important things:
 - get CI setup with an ant script.
 - REFACTOR the crap @sammko put in. Eww it's gross, we need to move some stuff around so that all the items and block extend our base class rather than remaking it all over again each time.
