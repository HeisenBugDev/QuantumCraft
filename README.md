# QuantumCraft

Yet another minecraft tech mod that ends with -craft.
IRC: irc.esper.net #QuantumCraft :)

## Intro
Visit the [minecraftforum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1891103-162-quantumcraft-wip/)
This is the github repo for QuantumCraft which will add some fun machines and a nice research system into Minecraft.

**We would love feedback so just send it on over!**

## [Todo and bug tracker](https://github.com/QuantumCraft/QuantumCraft/issues?state=open)

If you find an issue you can either submit it on github which would be the best, fork it fix it and send us a PR, or lastly send us a PM/post on [minecraftforum.net](http://www.minecraftforum.net/user/1122448-hunterboerner/)

**If you find a bug and do not report it, it will most likely _not_ get fixed**

## Downloads

You have a couple options for getting your hands on this mod. First, you can build from source with out nice and simple buildLocal.xml script.
Your option is to go to the [minecraftforum post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1891103-162-quantumcraft-wip/) and get a download from there.
Lastly, you could always bug us for a bleeding edge latest build (more info on contact below). _Note: both the minecraftforum option and asking us will most likely be through adf.ly, this is not because we hate you, it is because we would like to take five seconds of your time to try and make some $$$ off of this mod_

## Contact

If you would like to contact us directly for some reason (I dunno why), you can through either the IRC or minecraftforum.

  - IRC: irc.esper.net #QuantumCraft username: hunterb (If I don't respond within 5 minutes, I will most likely not get the message so please send it to me on mc forums so that it does not get lost in the terrible logs of doom)
 - sammko
  - he has to put his info here :P

## Credits

We took some of our code from MineFactory Reloaded if you are wondering why things look similar. The reason? He is a much better programmer and makes a good outline and base classes for stuff. Yeah, I have no clue what I am saying, let's hope his liscense allows this.
We also got some code from MrTJP who makes [Project: Red](https://github.com/MrTJP/ProjectRed)
We looked at TEX code for examples.


## Version explanation (no 11vB39Lq versions)

We will be using [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) _except_ anthing before 1.0. If it is 0.x then it means we have not officially released it and will not be considered stable or in anyway complete for playing. Once we get to 1.0 we will start using the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) scheme. I actually have no clue if this makes sense. How 'bout we just say that if it is a 0.x version then we are still working a lot on leveling everything out. Okay?

We will also be setting up some documentation soon with a todo list on what we are going to implement. We _may_ use what we did on the last version of QuantumCraft and just make a php site with bootstrap that is static.

## Helping out with the coding

If you would like to help out with coding, you can fork the branch and do some coding and the whole git routine. We are using git flow for our branching model. I may put some more stuff here eventually.
Buildcraft API is required.

CURRENTLY USING FORGE 9.10.0.849! (http://adf.ly/673885/http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/minecraftforge-src-1.6.2-9.10.1.849.zip)

_PLEASE USE GIT FLOW STUFF NO PUSH MASTER STUFF_

**If it is possible to mark an issue in code, do it the following way: //ISSUE #n.**
