QuantumCraft
============

Yet another minecraft tech mod that ends with -craft.

We took some of our code from MineFactory Reloaded if you are wondering why things look similar. The reason? He is a much better programmer and makes a good outline and base classes for stuff. Yeah, I have no clue what I am saying, let's hope his liscense allows this.

*PLEASE USE GIT FLOW STUFF NO PUSH MASTER STUFF*

THIS BRANCH IS HERE ONLY FOR THE LOCATION CARD FEATURE.

Todo important things:
 - get CI setup.
